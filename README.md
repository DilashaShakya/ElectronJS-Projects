# BuildYourBouquet - Electron Learning Projects 🌸

A comprehensive collection of Electron.js practice projects and applications built for learning desktop application development. This repository contains various small projects exploring different Electron concepts, from basic window management to IPC communication, file operations, and complete applications.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository showcases my iterative exploration of Electron.js through concept-focused projects and complete desktop applications. It reflects hands-on experience with Electron fundamentals, IPC patterns, file system operations, and UI integration. Several projects use tutorial-inspired foundations, extended with custom UI design, additional features, and independent experimentation.



## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 🎯 Main Applications

#### **Pomodoro Timer** (`/Pomodoro/timer`)
A beautiful desktop Pomodoro timer with custom pixel-art design, system tray integration, and sound notifications.

- **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Electron
- **Features**: Work/Break modes, animated GIFs, sound alerts, tray integration
- **Status**: Complete with custom design

### 📝 File Management Projects

#### **CRUD File Operations** (`/CRUD`)
File creation, reading, updating, and deletion operations using Electron's file system APIs.

#### **File Management System** (`/FileManagement`)
A complete file management interface for creating, reading, and deleting text files with custom save locations.

### 🔌 IPC (Inter-Process Communication) Projects

Multiple practice projects exploring Electron's IPC communication:

- **IPC** - Basic IPC communication between main and renderer processes
- **IPC_New** - Updated IPC patterns with preload scripts
- **IPC2** - Advanced IPC examples
- **IPC-Send** - Sending data from renderer to main process
- **IPC-Files** - File operations via IPC
- **IPC-Get_Random_Number** - IPC example with random number generation
- **Validate-IPC** - IPC with form validation
- **TypingStatus-IPC** - Real-time typing status communication

### 🎨 UI & Widget Projects

#### **Quote Widget** (`/QuoteWidget`)
A simple quote display widget application.

#### **Menu Demo** (`/menu-demo`)
Exploring Electron's menu system and context menus.

#### **Shell** (`/Shell`)
System shell command execution examples.

### 🧪 Concepts Practice (`/ConceptsPractice`)

A collection of small practice projects for specific Electron concepts:

- **BrowserWindows** - Multiple window management
- **Counter** - Basic counter with IPC
- **Decrement** - Counter with decrement functionality
- **MainRenderer** - Main and renderer process communication
- **Tray** - System tray integration examples

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Electron** - Desktop application framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Frontend technologies
- **React** (Pomodoro project) - UI framework
- **TypeScript** (Pomodoro project) - Type safety

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <folder>
```

2. Each project is independent. Navigate to a specific project:
```bash
cd Pomodoro/timer  # or any other project
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
npm start  # or npm run electron, depending on the project
```

## 📖 Learning Path

This repository follows a learning progression:

1. **Basic Concepts** - Window creation, simple UI
2. **IPC Communication** - Main/renderer process communication
3. **File Operations** - Reading/writing files
4. **Advanced Features** - System tray, menus, multiple windows
5. **Complete Applications** - Full-featured apps like Pomodoro Timer
