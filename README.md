# Electron Learning Projects 🌸

A comprehensive collection of Electron.js practice projects and applications built for learning desktop application development. This repository contains various small projects exploring different Electron concepts, from basic window management to IPC communication, file operations, and complete applications.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository showcases my iterative exploration of Electron.js through concept-focused projects and complete desktop applications. It reflects hands-on experience with Electron fundamentals, IPC patterns, file system operations, and UI integration. Several projects use tutorial-inspired foundations, extended with custom UI design, additional features, and independent experimentation.



## 🗂️ Project Structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <folder>
```

2. Each project is independent. Navigate to a specific project:
```bash
cd Pomodoro/timer  # or any other project
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
npm start  # or npm run electron, depending on the project
```
